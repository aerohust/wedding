Functionality, safety and reliability are the main pursposes of structural simulations. 

## Buckling and stress-stiffening
The stress-stiffening effect: a structure's laternal stiffness increases with the increases of its longitudial tensile stress.

## Dynamic simulations
be taken into account: inertia effect and damping effect
